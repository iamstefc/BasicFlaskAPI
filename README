I watched a video by Seattle Data Guy: https://youtu.be/SpaFPPByOhM
    It included a roadmap and so I decided to complete the Flask API (Step 2)

The video I decided to take a look at on 3/7/2022 is https://youtu.be/Z1RJmh_OqeA
I list the following terms or concepts mentioned:
    -   template inheritance
        -   syntax like {% block head %}{% endblock %}  is from the Jinja engine that flask uses
